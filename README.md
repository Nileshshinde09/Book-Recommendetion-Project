# BOOK RECOMMENDETION MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT 

A recommendation system is one of the top 
applications of data science. 
Every consumer Internet company requires a recommendation system like 
Netflix, Youtube, a news feed, etc. 
What you want to show out of a huge range of items 
is a recommendation system.

# What actually is Recommendation System
A recommendation engine is a class of 
machine learning which offers relevant 
suggestions to the customer.  
Before the recommendation system, the major tendency to 
buy was to take a suggestion from friends.
 But Now Google knows what news you will read, 
 Youtube knows what type of videos you will watch based on your 
 search history, watch history, or purchase history


# Types Of Recommendation System
# 1) Content-Based Filtering
# 2) Collaborative-based Filtering
# 3) Hybrid Filtering Method

In this project we are going to use first two types

    1) Content-Based Filtering
    2) Collaborative-based Filtering
